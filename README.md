To design and implement a computational system capable of automatically detecting sexism in Tweets. 
This system will use text-based natural language processing techniques and employ either machine or deep learning approaches. 
More specifically, this session focuses on:

• Preparing the dataset and familiarizing with the addressed task
• Data pre-processing, exploring multiple feature extraction methods
• Training and evaluating machine/deep-learning models
